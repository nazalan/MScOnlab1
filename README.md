 The aim of this thesis is to develop a two-phase game-theoretic model in which players
 simultaneously decide how to allocate their available resources. The model investigates
 under what conditions it is worthwhile to research one’s own zero-day vulnerability as a
 function of the expected payoff. The optimization of the resource allocation strategies
 behind this decision constitutes the subject of this thesis.
 The strategic importance of zero-day vulnerabilities has become an increasingly significant
 issue in cyber warfare and cybersecurity. The game-theoretic approach offers a
 means of analyzing these complex decision-making situations, especially in contexts where
 state and nonstate actors employ hidden and advantage-seeking strategies.
 This research can contribute to supporting cyber-strategic decision-making and the devel
opment of defense policy guidelines. Analysis of game-theoretic equilibria can shed light
 on how certain parameters, such as the value of a zero-day vulnerability or the gain of a
 successful attack, influence players’ decision preferences.
